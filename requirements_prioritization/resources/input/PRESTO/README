This folder contains the requirements prioritization dataset from the PRESTO project. More information about the project could be found in the following publication:
M. Robol and P. Busetta. Applying bdi to serious games: The presto experience.
Technical report, Universita di Trento, 2016.

The dataset contains three subsystems: SceneSelection, System, and Timeline; each in a separate folder. Each folder contains:
- list of requirements for that subsystem (requirements.csv)
- list of criteria for prioritization (criteria.csv)
- weights of the criteria (weights_criteria.csv)
- weights of the decision makers involved in the prioritization process (weights_players.csv)
- prioritizations of the requirements by each decision maker and for each criterion (ranking_pN.csv, where N=1, 2, 3, ... is the number of decision makers)
- the result of prioritization of the requirements by the team using two methods based on AHP (Prioritization_ahp_negotiator.csv, Prioritization_ahp_average.csv)
